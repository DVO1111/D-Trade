Project Summary
The Solana Wallet Portfolio API is a backend service built with Node.js and Express, designed to provide developers with access to SPL token balances and their corresponding USD prices for Solana wallets. This API is essential for integrating wallet balance and pricing data into decentralized applications (dApps) and financial tools, enhancing their functionality and user experience.

Project Module Description
GET /api/balances/:pubkey: Fetches all SPL token accounts for a specified wallet address, returning balances organized by token symbol, including native SOL.
GET /api/prices: Retrieves USD prices for all tokens listed in the TOKEN_MAP, with a fallback to DexScreener for tokens not priced by the Jupiter Price API.
GET /api/ping: A simple endpoint to check if the API is operational.
